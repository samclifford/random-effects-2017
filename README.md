# Visualisation of random effects in Bayesian hierarchical linear models

Exploring alternative ways to visualise the random effect means and intercepts in a hierarchical linear model of the rats data from Gelfand et al. (1990).

This poster is to be/was presented at the 2017 Bayes on the Beach workshop.

You may need to check for fonts on your system for LaTeX and you'll need JAGS installed to fit the model.
